    The behaviours control what is discovered from the Bitbucket server. The behaviours are grouped into a number
    of categories:
    <dl>
        <dt>Repository</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours determine what repositories get discovered. Only repositories that have at least one
            discovered branch / pull request can themselves be discovered.
        </dd>
        <dt>Within repository</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours determine what gets discovered within each repository. <strong>If you do not configure
            at least one discovery behaviour then nothing will be found!</strong></dd>
        <dt>General</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request. These behaviours
            are relevant to both Git and Mercurial based repositories
        </dd>
        <dt>Git</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request
            <strong>if and only if</strong> the repository is a Git repository. If the repository is a Mercurial
            repository, these behaviours will be silently ignored.
        </dd>
        <dt>Mercurial</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request
            <strong>if and only if</strong> the repository is a Mercurial repository. If the repository is a Git
            repository, these behaviours will be silently ignored.
        </dd>
